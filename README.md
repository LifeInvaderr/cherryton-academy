## How I started with this project
With this project, I wanted to get started as soon as possible due to project week, as well as having a fresh mind of the structure.

To begin the challenge, I used the module webpage as a reference, as to where to start, as well as how to face with debugging issues.

After hours of work, creating the models, I decided it would be time efficient if I were to import most features from the module to the challenge. Then debug from there.

## What I had struggled with
In this challenge, I didn't struggle as much as the others. From the modules, I decided to debug my models, ensuring that my tables were formatted correctly. 

From there, I took on the controller files. As to ensure that all of the get, post, put and destroy routers were correct.

From there on, focusing on the CSS wasn't that hard, only time consuming. As with bulma, formating to my goal was tricky.

## What I had learned
With this project, I have learned that downloading the css framework is usefull in the case of having limited internet in certain cases.

As I was able to make changes, on my commute which is great.

## What changes I would make
With this project, I think its a fun side thing that I want to update in adding the ability to add images to posts.
